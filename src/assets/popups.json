AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Google Gemini start off knowing nothing. If you tried to ask it a question at this stage it would just randomly guess words. If asked “what colour is a tree?” it may have responded “balloon giant the frog”, who knows. The same is the case for the letters you just made, the syntax and semantics would be completely wrong.",

Then when you next generate a random response, it's like will tweaking odds on the spinwheel to see if it gets closer or further to the answer you were expecting when asked the same question again. And it will probably get it wrong for hundreds, even thousands of attempts. But, eventually, it will say something like “the colour is brown” and the spinwheel odds will become much more biased towards that output, making it 1 in a billion that it would say something like “balloon giant the frog”. But, even once training is complete, every time an LLM answers your question it is still just continually making good guesses as to what the right words would be.",
